# Quantium Virtual Internship Project

## Overview

This repository contains the work completed during my Virtual Internship at Quantium, including the data analysis and insights for retail strategy and trial evaluation. The project involved analyzing transaction and customer data, assessing the impact of a retail trial, and developing strategic recommendations using advanced tools and techniques.

## Project Breakdown

## Data Analysis (Task 1)

- Tools Used: Python and R Studio.
- Techniques: Data cleaning, feature engineering, outlier detection, and exploratory data analysis (EDA).
- Statistical Methods: Utilized confidence intervals for trial testing to assess statistical significance and ensure robust results.

## Trial Analysis (Task 2)

- Tools Used: R Studio for statistical analysis and visualization.
- Techniques: Compared trial store performance to control stores, employing scaling factors and percentage difference analysis. Used confidence intervals to evaluate trial results and visualize impacts.

## Presentation Development (Task 3)

- Framework: Applied the Pyramid Principles to structure the report.
- Visualizations: Created consistent and clear charts and graphs in Excel, incorporated into PowerPoint for a comprehensive final report.

## Files Included

- Data Analysis Scripts: Python scripts for data cleaning, outlier detection, and analysis.
- Trial Analysis Scripts: R scripts for statistical analysis, including confidence interval calculations.
- Presentation Slides: PowerPoint presentation summarizing the project findings and recommendations.
- Charts and Graphs: Visualizations created in Python and included in the presentation.

## Usage

- To View Analysis: Open the provided Python and R scripts to review the data analysis and trial evaluation methods.
- To Review Presentation: Open the PowerPoint file in Task 3 folderto view the final report and recommendations.
